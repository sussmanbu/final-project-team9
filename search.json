    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "Other Research on Similar Topics\n\nA U.S. Census Bureau reasearch: “Share of Income Needed to Pay Rent Increased the Most for Low-Income Households From 2019 to 2021”\n\nFrom Census.Gov\nResearch conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau from 2019 to 2021 indicates a widespread trend of increased rent burden among renter households across all income levels. Notably, the study shows that the lowest-income quantile experienced the most significant impact, with the number of cost-burdened renter-occupied households rising from 85.5% to 87.3%, equating to approximately 10.9 million households in 2021.\n\n\n\nA Harvard research: “More Renters Than Ever Before Are Burdened by the Rent They Pay”\n\nFrom NEW YORK TIMES\nThe Harvard report also highlights this critical issue in the housing sector, revealing a substantial increase in rental burden across the United States using 2022 census data and draws similar concern as the study of U.S. Census Bureau. It found that an unprecedented 22.4 million households now allocate over 30% of their income to rent, with 12.1 million of U.S. households spending more than half of their income on this expense. This situation underscores the growing challenge of affordable housing, affecting renters’ financial stability and quality of life.\nThese studies reveal that low-income renters face a significant rent burden, guiding the creation of targeted affordable housing initiatives, for example like rental assistance programs tailored to prevent excessive rent spending, and housing policy reforms like rent control and incentives for low-income housing development. Underpinning the vital research on rent and income relationships effectively combat the housing affordability crisis. It underscores the commitment to ensuring everyone has access to safe, affordable housing and bolsters the economic resilience of low-income families by mitigating their rent-related financial pressures."

And other questions can also be answered like: Are there significant differences in rent burdens across different race groups or geographical locations? How do factors like age, employment status, and family size influence this relationship?\n\n\n\nThe dataset under investigation is sourced from IPUMS USA, a reputable platform that aggregates data collected through the U.S. Census and American Community Surveys (ACS). Our dataset is particularly focused on the year 2022. This website also includes data from other years, facilitating for further time-series analysis if needed. The dataset is substantial, containing 1,000,000 rows and 26 columns. The data can be grouped by various categories for detailed analysis and identifying trends. This dataset contains both numerical and categorical variables. Numerical variables include age, poverty level, total personal income, number of family members in households, and family income, among others. Categorical variables encompass sex, marital status, employment status, elevator and flush toilet availability, race, etc. One of the main challenges anticipated with this dataset is the presence of missing values, which could complicate data cleaning processes and affect the data size and quality. However, given the dataset’s large size, it remains feasible to extract a substantial sample (over 10,000 records) for robust analysis.\n\n\n\nIPUMS USA website\nA PDF containing screenshots of the selected variables on the IPUMS HEALTH SURVEY website\n*Through these variables names, look for the corresponding variable name in the first link and you see the specific description of each variable.

    "text": "The dataset under investigation is sourced from IPUMS USA, a reputable platform that aggregates data collected through the U.S. Census and American Community Surveys (ACS). Our dataset is particularly focused on the year 2022. This website also includes data from other years, facilitating for further time-series analysis if needed. The dataset is substantial, containing 1,000,000 rows and 26 columns. The data can be grouped by various categories for detailed analysis and identifying trends. This dataset contains both numerical and categorical variables. Numerical variables include age, poverty level, total personal income, number of family members in households, and family income, among others. Categorical variables encompass sex, marital status, employment status, elevator and flush toilet availability, race, etc. One of the main challenges anticipated with this dataset is the presence of missing values, which could complicate data cleaning processes and affect the data size and quality. However, given the dataset’s large size, it remains feasible to extract a substantial sample (over 10,000 records) for robust analysis."

    "text": "Introduction\nThis dataset is derived from IPUMS Health Surveys. The sources are from the reputable institutions including The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Stat/Transfer, State Health Access Data Assistance Center, and the University of Minnesota, underscoring its credibility. The primary data are derived from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), which collectively offer a rich and comprehensive dataset representative of the U.S. population. This dataset includes a wide range of variables, both numerical and categorical. Numerical variables cover aspects such as the age of diabetes diagnosis, household weight, family income, educational attainment, poverty level, enrollment fees or premiums for Medicaid plans and etc. Categorical variables include race, insurance coverage, diabetic pill consumption, types of diabetes and etc. The dataset’s size is large, containing over 10,000,000 columns and 24 rows. The dataset’s compatibility can allow us to use dplyr, forcats, lubridate and other skills as we learnt in this class to manipulate and visualize, which makes it an excellent resource for applying and expanding upon the analytical skills developed in class. However, several challenges are anticipated in working with this dataset. One issue is the data was not from these two years. This could limit the accuracy of attributing findings to current conditions. Additionally, there are soma self-reported answers in this dataset, which introduces potential biases. But wee think the large sample size may mitigate the impact of individual errors or biases. Technical challenges may arise during the data analysis, particularly in categorizing and analyzing diverse groups within the dataset."

Be creative!\n\n\n\nVideo Recording\nMake a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components. You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA. This video should be no longer than 4 minutes. Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website. This can be presented by any subset of the team members.\n\n\nRest of the Site\nFinally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site.\nThe main title of your page is informative. Each post has an author/description/informative title. All lab required posts are present. Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it. Your about page is up to date and clean. You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template."
