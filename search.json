IPUMS USA: Version 15.0 [dataset]. Minneapolis, MN: IPUMS, 2024. https://doi.org/10.18128/D010.V15.0\n\nThe original data of this website came from censuses as well as the American Community Surveys (ACS) that began in 2000 and are still going on today.\nWe chose our dataset from IPUMS because this website contains datasets that are large, valid and complex, containing detailed microdata, which aims to facilitate transformative research, education, and policy-making by aggregating data across times and places. It makes the datasets on this website very appropriate for our research to streamline our analysis of changes, data merging, and comparative research."

The presence of patterns in the residuals suggests a non-linear relationship between predictors and the response, indicating potential violations of linear model assumptions.\nThese issues could be attributed to large values and skewness in the data variables, leading us to consider alternative models, such as a log-log transformation to address these discrepancies."

This is often a minor issue in economic data, reflecting the variability in higher income or rent brackets, and doesn’t significantly affect the model’s overall validity.\nResiduals predominantly centering around the zero line signify no model bias, reinforcing the model’s accuracy.\nA small number of potential outliers deviate from the main cluster, which is typical in large economic datasets and generally does not markedly impact the robust central trend captured by the model.\n\n\nNormality of Residuals:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bulk of residuals align with the normality line on the Q-Q plot, with slight deviations at both ends.\nThese deviations, often seen in economic data due to outliers, do not substantially affect the model’s predictive capability.\n\n\nIID Errors:\n\n\n\n\n    Durbin-Watson test\n\ndata:  log_model_2022\nDW = 1.9775, p-value = 0.2092\nalternative hypothesis: true autocorrelation is greater than 0\n\n\n\nFor Durbin-Watson Statistic, the result value close to 2 indicates no autocorrelation, implying that the errors are independent. And for a random scatter of residuals, without visible trends or cycles, supports the assumption of IID errors.\n\n\nMulticollinearity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGVIF\nDf\nGVIF^(1/(2*Df))\n\n\n\n\nlog_INCTOT\n1.298351\n1\n1.139452\n\n\nROOMS\n1.069938\n1\n1.034378\n\n\nNFAMS\n1.088234\n1\n1.043185\n\n\nAGE\n2.109694\n1\n1.452479\n\n\nMARST\n1.790805\n5\n1.059997\n\n\nRACE\n1.193223\n8\n1.011102\n\n\nEMPSTAT\n1.844666\n2\n1.165412\n\n\nREGION_CLASSIFIED\n1.119686\n3\n1.019020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe adjusted GVIF values, being all near or below the threshold of 1.5 after taking the root, demonstrate that the multicollinearity is likely not distorting the estimates in the regression model significantly. This implies that each predictor variable is providing unique information that is not overly redundant with other variables in the model.\n\nUpon reviewing these diagnostic measures, the model is deemed well-fitted, and the derived conclusions are robust and reliable."

We’re now exploring nonlinearity further and addressing the potential skewness identified in the conclusions of Model 3.\n\n\n\nVariable Selection and Refinement:\n\nThe interaction term EMPSTAT * FTOTINC has been introduced to investigate the suspected interaction effect between employment status and total family income.\nPost inclusion, the p-value for EMPSTATUnemployed:FTOTINC is slightly above 0.05, suggesting it has borderline statistical significance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n5.1113135\n0.1036114\n49.3315824\n0.0000000\n\n\nlog_INCTOT\n0.1331529\n0.0073835\n18.0338588\n0.0000000\n\n\nROOMS\n0.0299321\n0.0035566\n8.4158816\n0.0000000\n\n\nNFAMS\n0.0555431\n0.0098767\n5.6236800\n0.0000000\n\n\nAGE\n-0.0027305\n0.0005401\n-5.0552371\n0.0000004\n\n\nMARSTMarried, spouse absent\n0.0941770\n0.0450879\n2.0887414\n0.0367801\n\n\nMARSTMarried, spouse present\n0.1370358\n0.0230398\n5.9477787\n0.0000000\n\n\nMARSTNever married/single\n0.0896923\n0.0234201\n3.8297086\n0.0001298\n\n\nMARSTSeparated\n0.0307051\n0.0434374\n0.7068820\n0.4796719\n\n\nMARSTWidowed\n0.1049586\n0.0350501\n2.9945293\n0.0027618\n\n\nRACEBlack/African American\n0.2465346\n0.0660208\n3.7341954\n0.0001904\n\n\nRACEChinese\n0.2966334\n0.0865709\n3.4264776\n0.0006163\n\n\nRACEJapanese\n0.3086582\n0.1385602\n2.2276104\n0.0259496\n\n\nRACEOther Asian or Pacific Islander\n0.3309648\n0.0695640\n4.7577031\n0.0000020\n\n\nRACEOther race, nec\n0.2729952\n0.0669648\n4.0766956\n0.0000464\n\n\nRACEThree or more major races\n0.3456014\n0.0936388\n3.6907926\n0.0002259\n\n\nRACETwo major races\n0.2766317\n0.0663374\n4.1700733\n0.0000310\n\n\nRACEWhite\n0.2627766\n0.0639610\n4.1083889\n0.0000405\n\n\nEMPSTATNot in labour force\n-0.0908464\n0.0233084\n-3.8975885\n0.0000984\n\n\nEMPSTATUnemployed\n0.0561573\n0.0526989\n1.0656248\n0.2866433\n\n\nFTOTINC\n0.0000019\n0.0000001\n13.5815058\n0.0000000\n\n\nREGION_CLASSIFIEDNORTHEAST\n0.2611149\n0.0237360\n11.0007889\n0.0000000\n\n\nREGION_CLASSIFIEDSOUTH\n0.1904665\n0.0206891\n9.2061053\n0.0000000\n\n\nREGION_CLASSIFIEDWEST\n0.4456625\n0.0220563\n20.2057095\n0.0000000\n\n\nEMPSTATNot in labour force:FTOTINC\n0.0000017\n0.0000003\n5.3486949\n0.0000001\n\n\nEMPSTATUnemployed:FTOTINC\n0.0000006\n0.0000010\n0.6301514\n0.5286235\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe integration of the interaction term retains the significance of other variables, with no detrimental impact on the model’s variables as reflected in their p-values.\n\n\n\nModel Inferences:\n\nThere is a noticeable shift in the coefficient from 0.1334 to 0.1715199 after adding the interaction term. This change suggests that employment status may moderate the influence of total family income on gross rent. Specifically, a 10% increase in total income (INCTOT) now corresponds to a 17.15% increase in gross rent (RENTGRS), ceteris paribus.\n\n\n\nStatistical Performance Assessment:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr.squared\nadj.r.squared\nsigma\nstatistic\np.value\ndf\nlogLik\nAIC\nBIC\ndeviance\ndf.residual\nnobs\n\n\n\n\n0.2727009\n0.2691641\n0.4920608\n77.10474\n0\n25\n-3654.429\n7362.857\n7539.709\n1244.758\n5141\n5167\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll predictors show statistical significance, with the exception of certain categories within marital status and employment status, indicating robustness in the variable selection.\n\n\n\nDiscussion of the model:\n-The residual plot suggested an acceptable fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis model also meet all the assumption we discussed in section 3.\n\nTherefore, this model’s conclusions offer a credible extension to our understanding of the economic factors influencing rent prices in section 3."

Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this. (While not a hard limit, around 5 total figures is probably a good target.)\nDefault lm output and plots are typically not acceptable.\n\nClarity of Explanations\n\nHow well do you explain each figure/result?\nDo you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?\n\nOrganization and cleanliness.\n\nMake sure to remove excessive warnings, hide most or all code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.\nThis page should be self-contained, i.e. provide a description of the relevant data."

Notably, the study shows that the lowest-income quantile experienced the most significant impact, with the number of cost-burdened renter-occupied households rising from 85.5% to 87.3%, equating to approximately 10.9 million households in 2021.\n\n\n\nA Harvard research: “More Renters Than Ever Before Are Burdened by the Rent They Pay”\n\nFrom NEW YORK TIMES\nThe Harvard report also highlights this critical issue in the housing sector, revealing a substantial increase in rental burden across the United States using 2022 census data and draws similar concern as the study of U.S. Census Bureau. It found that an unprecedented 22.4 million households now allocate over 30% of their income to rent, with 12.1 million of U.S. households spending more than half of their income on this expense. This situation underscores the growing challenge of affordable housing, affecting renters’ financial stability and quality of life.\nThese studies reveal that low-income renters face a significant rent burden, guiding the creation of targeted affordable housing initiatives, for example like rental assistance programs tailored to prevent excessive rent spending, and housing policy reforms like rent control and incentives for low-income housing development. Underpinning the vital research on rent and income relationships effectively combat the housing affordability crisis. It underscores the commitment to ensuring everyone has access to safe, affordable housing and bolsters the economic resilience of low-income families by mitigating their rent-related financial pressures."

Furthermore, for our dependent variable—rent—we exclude records indicating a rent of 0. This exclusion is based on the understanding that a 0 rent suggests the individual owns their home or lives in a situation not pertinent to our target research population, which is individuals who rent their housing. Given the original dataset comprises millions of samples, the exclusion of these data points still leaves us with the sufficiently cleaned large dataset for robust analysis."

But generally, both of these indicators are in a acceptable range.\nThe p.value column shows zeros across all years, indicating that the overall model is statistically significant each year.\nThe logLik (log-likelihood) values are negative and increase in magnitude over time, possibly indicating that the model’s fit is improving or that the variability in the data is increasing.\nThe AIC and BIC values also generally increase over time, which could suggest that the complexity of the model or the information loss is growing.\nThe deviance shows how much of the total variability is not explained by the model; the trends here are not immediately clear without further context.\nThe df.residual (degrees of freedom of residuals) decreases slightly over time, indicating that there might be more parameters in the model or less data available in later years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coefficient for log_INCTOT has fluctuated over the years, indicating varying degrees of association between INCTOT and the dependent variable in the model.\nThere are some years where the coefficient estimate peaks sharply, particularly noticeable in the early 2000s and again around 2020.\nConversely, there are troughs that follow these peaks, suggesting periods of less influence or a negative correction in the relationship.\nThe trend is not monotonic; it does not consistently increase or decrease but rather has multiple peaks and valleys.\nThe repeated rise and fall of the coefficient estimate could imply a cyclical pattern that repeats over several years.\nThe range of the coefficient estimates is relatively tight, with the lowest around 0.12 and the highest just above 0.14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike the previous plot for log_INCTOT coefficients, the R-squared values here also show variability over time with no clear or consistent trend.\nThe R-squared values represent the proportion of the variance for the dependent variable that’s explained by the independent variables in the model. The fluctuation suggests that the model’s explanatory power changes from year to year.\nNotably, there’s a sharp drop in the R-squared value in the most recent year shown, which could indicate a sudden decrease in the model’s predictive power or a significant change in the underlying data structure for these years."

But generally, both of these indicators are in a acceptable range.\nThe p.value column shows zeros across all years, indicating that the overall model is statistically significant each year.\nThe logLik (log-likelihood) values are negative and increase in magnitude over time, possibly indicating that the model’s fit is improving or that the variability in the data is increasing.\nThe AIC and BIC values also generally increase over time, which could suggest that the complexity of the model or the information loss is growing.\nThe deviance shows how much of the total variability is not explained by the model; the trends here are not immediately clear without further context.\nThe df.residual (degrees of freedom of residuals) decreases slightly over time, indicating that there might be more parameters in the model or less data available in later years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coefficient for log_INCTOT has fluctuated over the years, indicating varying degrees of association between INCTOT and the dependent variable in the model.\nThere are some years where the coefficient estimate peaks sharply, particularly noticeable in the early 2000s and again around 2020.\nConversely, there are troughs that follow these peaks, suggesting periods of less influence or a negative correction in the relationship.\nThe trend is not monotonic; it does not consistently increase or decrease but rather has multiple peaks and valleys.\nThe repeated rise and fall of the coefficient estimate could imply a cyclical pattern that repeats over several years.\nThe range of the coefficient estimates is relatively tight, with the lowest around 0.12 and the highest just above 0.14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike the previous plot for log_INCTOT coefficients, the R-squared values here also show variability over time with no clear or consistent trend.\nThe R-squared values represent the proportion of the variance for the dependent variable that’s explained by the independent variables in the model. The fluctuation suggests that the model’s explanatory power changes from year to year.\nNotably, there’s a sharp drop in the R-squared value in the most recent year shown, which could indicate a sudden decrease in the model’s predictive power or a significant change in the underlying data structure for these years."

However, this is common in non-transformed data and it is our one of the limitation in our model.\nThis log-transformed model seems to perform better in terms of having residuals more consistently distributed around zero. This suggests that the log transformation helped to stabilize the variance of the residuals and improve the model’s homoscedasticity.\n\n\nlibrary(lattice)\n\n# Q-Q plot for normality\nqqmath(resid(model_with_income_log), distribution = qnorm,\n       main = \"Q-Q Plot for Model Residuals\", \n       xlab = \"Theoretical Quantiles\", \n       ylab = \"Sample Quantiles\")\n\n\n\n# Residuals vs Fitted plot for homoscedasticity\nplot(residuals(model_with_income_log) ~ fitted(model_with_income_log))\nabline(h = 0, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\nqqPlot(resid(model_with_income_log), main = \"Q-Q Plot for Model Residuals\")\n\n\n\n\n[1] 24314 25857\n\n\n\nThe Q-Q plot we got for model residuals suggests similar issues with our residual plot, however, this is common and again one of our limitation of our model.\nThe Q-Q plot captures the overall trend and relevant factors, despite the presence of certain outliers.\nThe residuals at the lower and upper ends of the distribution deviate from the line, which indicates that the distribution of residuals has heavier tails than the normal distribution. This means there are more extreme values (outliers) than you would expect if the residuals were perfectly normally distributed."

This is a relatively low R-squared value, indicating that the linear model does not explain a large portion of the variability in the rent.But it is fair, because we only include one predictor here.\nThe statistic value is 594, which is extremely high. This suggests that the overall significance of the model is strong, despite the low R-squared. This could be due to a large sample size, which can make even small relationships appear statistically significant.\n\n\n\nResidual plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis diagram indicates that the spread of residuals appears to increase as the fitted values increase. This pattern indicates heteroscedasticity, which means that the variability of the residuals is not constant across levels of the predictor variable. In an ideal scenario, I’d want to see a consistent spread of residuals across all levels of fitted values, suggesting homoscedasticity."

This might suggest that properties with more rooms may house more families and potentially lead to higher rents.\nNotably, Age has a moderate negative correlation with Number of Families, which could hint at younger populations having larger family sizes or vice versa, but this is not a strong relationship.

With a GVIF^(1/(2*Df)) value of INCTOT approximately 1.50 and FTOTINC is about 1.47, a VIF between 1 and 5 suggests moderate indication of multicollinearity.\nTherefore, we decide to exclude the FTOTINC to avioud the multicollineariity problem.\n\n\n\nNew model after excluding FTOTINC\n\n\nResidual plot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeterskedasticity still exits as the spread of the residuals appears to be increasing with the fitted values.

To address this, we have refined our dataset to include only those records where rent and income fall within three standard deviations from their respective sample means to minimize the impact of extreme values on the model’s performance.\n\n\nRegression Coefficients Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n5.1300453\n0.1067311\n48.0651464\n0.0000000\n\n\nlog_INCTOT\n0.1334422\n0.0076099\n17.5353005\n0.0000000\n\n\nROOMS\n0.0417813\n0.0036000\n11.6060404\n0.0000000\n\n\nNFAMS\n0.0329669\n0.0100882\n3.2678822\n0.0010907\n\n\nAGE\n-0.0035780\n0.0005543\n-6.4554553\n0.0000000\n\n\nMARSTMarried, spouse absent\n0.1202752\n0.0463969\n2.5923119\n0.0095603\n\n\nMARSTMarried, spouse present\n0.2037563\n0.0234393\n8.6929177\n0.0000000\n\n\nMARSTNever married/single\n0.1093599\n0.0241056\n4.5366957\n0.0000058\n\n\nMARSTSeparated\n0.0317849\n0.0447714\n0.7099382\n0.4777746\n\n\nMARSTWidowed\n0.1003713\n0.0360489\n2.7843077\n0.0053838\n\n\nRACEBlack/African American\n0.2424072\n0.0680509\n3.5621460\n0.0003712\n\n\nRACEChinese\n0.2865844\n0.0892336\n3.2116179\n0.0013280\n\n\nRACEJapanese\n0.3096517\n0.1428069\n2.1683238\n0.0301798\n\n\nRACEOther Asian or Pacific Islander\n0.3673317\n0.0716731\n5.1251000\n0.0000003\n\n\nRACEOther race, nec\n0.2807254\n0.0690242\n4.0670562\n0.0000483\n\n\nRACEThree or more major races\n0.3548441\n0.0965187\n3.6764279\n0.0002389\n\n\nRACETwo major races\n0.2827093\n0.0683784\n4.1344834\n0.0000361\n\n\nRACEWhite\n0.2663832\n0.0659283\n4.0405009\n0.0000541\n\n\nEMPSTATNot in labour force\n-0.0361988\n0.0222177\n-1.6292740\n0.1033163\n\n\nEMPSTATUnemployed\n0.0756027\n0.0430993\n1.7541506\n0.0794642\n\n\nREGION_CLASSIFIEDNORTHEAST\n0.2785550\n0.0244342\n11.4002308\n0.0000000\n\n\nREGION_CLASSIFIEDSOUTH\n0.1916896\n0.0213248\n8.9890579\n0.0000000\n\n\nREGION_CLASSIFIEDWEST\n0.4657014\n0.0227049\n20.5110144\n0.0000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coefficient (elasticity) of 0.1334 means that a 10% increase in total income (INCTOT) is associated with an average 13.34% increase in rent gross (RENTGRS), given that other variables in the model are held constant.\nThe idea in the above conclusion that higher income leads to increased rent payments is plausible. As people earn more, they may choose to live in better accommodations or neighborhoods, which could result in higher rent expenses. And it is reliable that they only spend part of income increase on the rent.\n\n\n\nModel Fit Statistics Table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr.squared\nadj.r.squared\nsigma\nstatistic\np.value\ndf\nlogLik\nAIC\nBIC\ndeviance\ndf.residual\nnobs\n\n\n\n\n0.2267776\n0.2234707\n0.5072099\n68.5763\n0\n22\n-3812.614\n7673.227\n7830.428\n1323.355\n5144\n5167\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResiduals and Related Statistics Table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog_RENTGRS\nlog_INCTOT\nROOMS\nNFAMS\nAGE\nMARST\nRACE\nEMPSTAT\nREGION_CLASSIFIED\n.fitted\n.resid\n.hat\n.sigma\n.cooksd\n.std.resid\n\n\n\n\n5.533390\n10.803649\n3\n1\n63\nWidowed\nWhite\nEmployed\nSOUTH\n7.063047\n-1.5296573\n0.0046116\n0.5068085\n0.0018406\n-3.0228050\n\n\n8.006368\n11.406453\n7\n1\n76\nMarried, spouse present\nWhite\nEmployed\nWEST\n7.641494\n0.3648738\n0.0028825\n0.5072336\n0.0000652\n0.7204133\n\n\n7.715124\n7.313220\n5\n4\n24\nNever married/single\nWhite\nNot in labour force\nWEST\n7.166084\n0.5490394\n0.0057515\n0.5072011\n0.0002964\n1.0855961\n\n\n7.246368\n10.434116\n3\n1\n54\nMarried, spouse present\nWhite\nEmployed\nWEST\n7.423335\n-0.1769664\n0.0018337\n0.5072532\n0.0000097\n-0.3492220\n\n\n7.279319\n7.600903\n3\n1\n33\nNever married/single\nOther race, nec\nNot in labour force\nSOUTH\n6.730138\n0.5491807\n0.0045363\n0.5072012\n0.0002333\n1.0852126\n\n\n7.644441\n9.239899\n6\n1\n17\nNever married/single\nWhite\nEmployed\nMIDWEST\n6.961608\n0.6828322\n0.0021250\n0.5071697\n0.0001682\n1.3476844\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe adjusted R-squared is 0.223. This value looks modest. In practical terms, it suggests that the model doesn’t explain a large portion of the variance in the logarithm of rent. But in this social science and economic contexts, however, it is not uncommon to have lower R-squared values due to the complexity of human behavior and multiple unobserved factors. So we believe it is acceptable.\nThe p-value for the overall model is extremely low, which is good. It indicates that the model predictors, as a set, are statistically significantly associated with the response variable, the logarithm of rent.\nThe sigma value is the standard deviation of the error terms and is lower. This suggests that the residuals in this model are less spread out, indicating a tighter fit of the model to the data. However, since the scale is different from the previous model (which was on a log scale), this improvement is difficult to directly compare.\n\n\n\nResidual plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residuals appear to be centered around zero, which is good as it suggests no bias in the predictions.\nThere is some evidence of heteroscedasticity as the residuals seem to fan out as the fitted values increase, which is common in non-transformed data.\nThere are no clear patterns in the residuals, which suggests that the model catch the nonlinear relationships.\nThis log-transformed model seems to perform better in terms of having residuals more consistently distributed around zero. This suggests that the log transformation helped to stabilize the variance of the residuals and improve the model’s homoscedasticity."

Conversely, the interaction term “EMPSTATNot in labor force:FTOTINC” exhibits strong statistical significance. In light of the latter’s significance, there is a rationale to retain this interaction term in the model.\nFurthermore, the addition of this interaction term does not adversely affect the performance of the other variables, as assessed by their respective p-values.\nThe inclusion of the interaction term also leads to a notable alteration in the coefficient of the primary regressor, shifting from 0.1334 to 0.1715199, indicating a potential moderating effect of employment status on the relationship between total family income and gross rent.\n\n\n\nResidual plot\n\n# Calculate residuals and fitted values\nresiduals_2022 &lt;- resid(log_model_2022)\nfitted_values_2022 &lt;- fitted(log_model_2022)\n\n# Create a residual plot\nplot(fitted_values_2022, residuals_2022, \n     xlab = \"Fitted Values\", ylab = \"Residuals\",\n     main = \"Residual Plot\", pch = 20)\nabline(h = 0, col = \"red\") \n\n\n\n\n\nThe residual plot provided appears to maintain consistent performance compared to the model without the interaction term, indicating that the addition of the term does not deteriorate the model’s predictive capacity.\nThe dispersion of residuals suggests homoscedasticity, as there is no evident pattern of increasing or decreasing variance across the range of fitted values. This uniform spread is desirable and aligns with the assumption of equal variance (homoscedasticity) in linear regression models."

It suggests that the mean is likely to be higher than the median, which corresponds to the stats in the above section. There are a few bars past the $6000 mark, which could be considered outliers. There’s a wide range of rents; however, the majority of the data points fall below $3000, suggesting that while there are rents across a wide range.\n2.INCTOT\n\nggplot(rent_data_clean, aes(x = INCTOT)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 100, fill = \"blue\", color = \"black\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Total Personal Income\",\n       x = \"Total Personal Income\",\n       y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram shows a very high peak at the lower end of the income range, suggest a right-skewed distribution. This suggests that a significant portion of the population earns within this lower income bracket. But it is what I expected because it’s the most common income range in the datasets and our dataset is from census.\n3.FTOTINC\n\nggplot(rent_data_clean, aes(x = FTOTINC)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 100, fill = \"blue\", color = \"black\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Total Family Income\",\n       x = \"Total Family Income\",\n       y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\nSimliarly as the INCTOT, the histogram shows that the distribution of total family income is right-skewed, meaning most families have an income toward the lower end of the scale, with fewer families earning higher incomes. The tail might include outliers, which are families with significantly higher incomes than the typical family and the variance and standard deviation are likely to be large.\n4.NFAMS\n\nnfams_counts &lt;- rent_data_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(NFAMS) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n())\n\nggplot(nfams_counts, aes(x = factor(NFAMS), y = Count, fill = factor(NFAMS))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Bar Chart of Number of Family Members\",\n       x = \"Number of Family Members\",\n       y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) \n\n\n\n\nThe bar representing one family member is significantly taller than the others, indicating that single-person families are most common in this dataset. There is a rapid decrease in frequency as the number of family members increases. The families with a very large number of members are quite rare. This is what I expected and aligns with my understanding to common demographic trends.\n5.Age\n\nggplot(rent_data_clean, aes(x = AGE)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = \"cornflowerblue\", color = \"black\") + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Age\",\n       x = \"Age\",\n       y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n6.POVERTY\n\np &lt;- ggplot(rent_data_clean, aes(x = POVERTY)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"darkgreen\", color = \"black\") + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Poverty Scores\",\n       x = \"Poverty Score\",\n       y = \"Frequency\")\n\np &lt;- p + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, color = \"blue\", linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1, y = Inf, label = \"001 = ≤1% of poverty threshold\", angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 2, color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 501, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 501, y = Inf, label = \"501 = ≥501% of poverty threshold\", angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 2, color = \"red\")\n\nprint(p)\n\n\n\n\nThis variable has both upper and lower bounds. Therefore, the histogram is characterized by notable concentrations, indicating significant proportions of individuals or families at both ends of the poverty spectrum.\n7.EMPSTAT\n\nempstat_counts &lt;- rent_data_clean %&gt;%\n  count(EMPSTAT) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percentage = n / sum(n) * 100)\nggplot(empstat_counts, aes(x = \"\", y = n, fill = EMPSTAT)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 1) +\n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\") + \n  theme_void() + \n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%1.1f%%\", Percentage)), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +\n  labs(title = \"Pie Chart of Employment Status\", fill = \"Employment Status\")\n\n\n\n\n\nKitchen\n\n\nkitchen_counts &lt;- rent_data_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(KITCHEN) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n()) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percentage = Count / sum(Count) * 100)\nggplot(kitchen_counts, aes(x = \"\", y = Count, fill = factor(KITCHEN))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 1) +\n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%1.1f%%\", Percentage)), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +\n  labs(title = \"Pie Chart of Kitchen\",fill = \"Number of Kitchens\")\n\n\n\n\n\nROOMS\n\n\nrooms_counts &lt;- rent_data_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(ROOMS) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n()) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percentage = Count / sum(Count) * 100)\n\nggplot(rooms_counts, aes(x = factor(ROOMS), y = Count, fill = factor(ROOMS))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%1.1f%%\", Percentage), y = Count), vjust = -0.3, color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Bar Chart of Room Counts\", x = \"Number of Rooms\", y = \"Count\") +\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Number of Rooms\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n\nRACE\n\n\nrace_counts &lt;- rent_data_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(RACE) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n()) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percentage = Count / sum(Count) * 100)\n\nggplot(race_counts, aes(x = factor(RACE), y = Count, fill = factor(RACE))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%1.1f%%\", Percentage), y = Count), vjust = -0.3, color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Bar Chart of RACE\", x = \"RACE\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=0.5))\n\n\n\n\n11.MARST\n\nmarst_counts &lt;- rent_data_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(MARST) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n()) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percentage = Count / sum(Count) * 100)\n\nggplot(marst_counts, aes(x = factor(MARST), y = Count, fill = factor(MARST))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%1.1f%%\", Percentage), y = Count), vjust = -0.3, color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Bar Chart of Marital Status\", x = \"Marital Status\", y = \"Count\", fill = \"Marital Status Categories\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))"

    "text": "Introduction\nThis dataset is derived from IPUMS Health Surveys. The sources are from the reputable institutions including The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Stat/Transfer, State Health Access Data Assistance Center, and the University of Minnesota, underscoring its credibility. The primary data are derived from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), which collectively offer a rich and comprehensive dataset representative of the U.S. population. This dataset includes a wide range of variables, both numerical and categorical. Numerical variables cover aspects such as the age of diabetes diagnosis, household weight, family income, educational attainment, poverty level, enrollment fees or premiums for Medicaid plans and etc. Categorical variables include race, insurance coverage, diabetic pill consumption, types of diabetes and etc. The dataset’s size is large, containing over 10,000,000 columns and 24 rows. The dataset’s compatibility can allow us to use dplyr, forcats, lubridate and other skills as we learnt in this class to manipulate and visualize, which makes it an excellent resource for applying and expanding upon the analytical skills developed in class. However, several challenges are anticipated in working with this dataset. One issue is the data was not from these two years. This could limit the accuracy of attributing findings to current conditions. Additionally, there are soma self-reported answers in this dataset, which introduces potential biases. But wee think the large sample size may mitigate the impact of individual errors or biases. Technical challenges may arise during the data analysis, particularly in categorizing and analyzing diverse groups within the dataset."
