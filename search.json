It suggests that the mean is likely to be higher than the median, which corresponds to the stats in the above section. -There are a few bars past the $6000 mark, which could be considered outliers. -There’s a wide range of rents; however, the majority of the data points fall below $3000, suggesting that while there are rents across a wide range. -According to the right skewd nature, we take a log transformation to it in later on regression model.\n2.INCTOT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram shows a very high peak at the lower end of the income range, suggest a right-skewed distribution. This suggests that a significant portion of the population earns within this lower income bracket. But it is what I expected because it’s the most common income range in the datasets and our dataset is from census.\n-According to the right skewd nature, we take a log transformation to it in later on regression model.\n\n3.FTOTINC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimliarly as the INCTOT, the histogram shows that the distribution of total family income is right-skewed, meaning most families have an income toward the lower end of the scale, with fewer families earning higher incomes. The tail might include outliers, which are families with significantly higher incomes than the typical family and the variance and standard deviation are likely to be large.\nThis variable shows to be related with INCTOT, we should test the multicollineaity issue while include it in our model.\nConsidering its nature and the possible multicollinearity issue, we plan to replace INCTOT to this variable to see if it suggests any change.\n\n4.NFAMS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar representing one family member is significantly taller than the others, indicating that single-person families are most common in this dataset. There is a rapid decrease in frequency as the number of family members increases. The families with a very large number of members are quite rare. This is what I expected and aligns with my understanding to common demographic trends."

Notably, the study shows that the lowest-income quantile experienced the most significant impact, with the number of cost-burdened renter-occupied households rising from 85.5% to 87.3%, equating to approximately 10.9 million households in 2021.\n\n\n\nA Harvard research: “More Renters Than Ever Before Are Burdened by the Rent They Pay”\n\nFrom NEW YORK TIMES\nThe Harvard report also highlights this critical issue in the housing sector, revealing a substantial increase in rental burden across the United States using 2022 census data and draws similar concern as the study of U.S. Census Bureau. It found that an unprecedented 22.4 million households now allocate over 30% of their income to rent, with 12.1 million of U.S. households spending more than half of their income on this expense. This situation underscores the growing challenge of affordable housing, affecting renters’ financial stability and quality of life.\nThese studies reveal that low-income renters face a significant rent burden, guiding the creation of targeted affordable housing initiatives, for example like rental assistance programs tailored to prevent excessive rent spending, and housing policy reforms like rent control and incentives for low-income housing development. Underpinning the vital research on rent and income relationships effectively combat the housing affordability crisis. It underscores the commitment to ensuring everyone has access to safe, affordable housing and bolsters the economic resilience of low-income families by mitigating their rent-related financial pressures."

Furthermore, for our dependent variable—rent—we exclude records indicating a rent of 0. This exclusion is based on the understanding that a 0 rent suggests the individual owns their home or lives in a situation not pertinent to our target research population, which is individuals who rent their housing. Given the original dataset comprises millions of samples, the exclusion of these data points still leaves us with the sufficiently cleaned large dataset for robust analysis."

But generally, both of these indicators are in a acceptable range.\nThe p.value column shows zeros across all years, indicating that the overall model is statistically significant each year.\nThe logLik (log-likelihood) values are negative and increase in magnitude over time, possibly indicating that the model’s fit is improving or that the variability in the data is increasing.\nThe AIC and BIC values also generally increase over time, which could suggest that the complexity of the model or the information loss is growing.\nThe deviance shows how much of the total variability is not explained by the model; the trends here are not immediately clear without further context.\nhe df.residual (degrees of freedom of residuals) decreases slightly over time, indicating that there might be more parameters in the model or less data available in later years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coefficient for log_INCTOT has fluctuated over the years, indicating varying degrees of association between INCTOT and the dependent variable in the model.\nThere are some years where the coefficient estimate peaks sharply, particularly noticeable in the early 2000s and again around 2020.\nConversely, there are troughs that follow these peaks, suggesting periods of less influence or a negative correction in the relationship.\nThe trend is not monotonic; it does not consistently increase or decrease but rather has multiple peaks and valleys.\nThe repeated rise and fall of the coefficient estimate could imply a cyclical pattern that repeats over several years.\nThe range of the coefficient estimates is relatively tight, with the lowest around 0.12 and the highest just above 0.14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike the previous plot for log_INCTOT coefficients, the R-squared values here also show variability over time with no clear or consistent trend.\nThe R-squared values represent the proportion of the variance for the dependent variable that’s explained by the independent variables in the model. The fluctuation suggests that the model’s explanatory power changes from year to year.\nNotably, there’s a sharp drop in the R-squared value in the most recent year shown, which could indicate a sudden decrease in the model’s predictive power or a significant change in the underlying data structure for these years."

Publish site to https://sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME/ using gh-pages? (Y/n)\n[[OP]] Wait for the process to finish.\nOnce it is done, you can go to the URL it asked you about to see your site.\n\nNote: This is the process you will use every time you want to update your published site. Make sure to always follow the steps below for rendering, previewing, and committing your changes before doing these publish steps. Anyone can publish in the future.\n\n\nCustomize your site\n\n[[OP]] Open the _quarto.yml file and update the title to include your team name.\n[[OP]] Go to the about.qmd and remove the TF’s and professor’s names.\nadd your own along with a short introduction and a link to your Github user page.\n[[OP]] Render the site.\n[[OP]] Check and make sure you didn’t get any errors.\n[[OP]] Commit your changes and push.\n[[OP]] Repeat the steps under Setting up your site.\n\nOnce one person is done with this, each teammate in the group can, in turn, repeat steps 3-7. Before doing so, make sure to pull the changes from teammates before starting to make new changes. (We’ll talk soon about ways to organize your work and resolve conflicts.)\n\n\nStart your first post\n\nTo start your first post first, run remotes::install_github(\"sussmanbu/quartopost\") in your Console.\n[[OP]] Run quartopost::quartopost() (or click Addins-&gt;Create Quarto Post, or use C-Shift-P, type “Create Quarto” and press enter to run the command).\n\nNow you can start working on your post. You’ll want to render your post to see what it will look like on the site.\n\nEvery time you want to make a new post, you can repeat step 2 above.\nWhen you want to publish your progress, follow steps 4-7 from Customize your site.\n\nFinally, make sure to read through everything on this site which has the directions and rubric for the final project."

Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

This is a relatively low R-squared value, indicating that the linear model does not explain a large portion of the variability in the rent.But it is fair, because we only include one predictor here.\nThe statistic value is 594, which is extremely high.

This is a significant improvement over the simple linear model previously discussed, suggesting that including more variables helps explain the variance in the dependent variable more effectively.\nThe adjusted R-squared value is 0.2807292, which is very close to the R-squared value.Since the adjusted R-squared is almost identical to the R-squared, this implies that the additional predictors are indeed contributing valuable information.\nThe statistic value is 98.57, which is very high and the p-value is 0, indicating that the model is statistically significant.

While considering the what constitutes the Family total income, it is fair multicollinearity happens. So we decide to exclude the FTOTINC in our model. With a GVIF^(1/(2*Df)) value of INCTOT approximately 1.50 and FTOTINC is about 1.47, a VIF between 1 and 5 suggests moderate indication of multicollinearity.\nTherefore, we decide to exclude the FTOTINC to avioud the multicollineariity problem.\n\n\n\nResidual plot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeterskedasticity still exits as the spread of the residuals appears to be increasing with the fitted values. According to the diagram, the residuals seem to form a pattern (rather than being randomly dispersed), it indicates that the relationship between the predictors and the response variable is not entirely linear."

To address this, we have refined our dataset to include only those records where rent and income fall within three standard deviations from their respective sample means to minimize the impact of extreme values on the model’s performance.\n\n\nRegression Coefficients Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n5.1366895\n0.1226201\n41.8910906\n0.0000000\n\n\nlog_INCTOT\n0.1334432\n0.0076107\n17.5337350\n0.0000000\n\n\nKITCHENYes (shared or exclusive use)\n-0.0066589\n0.0604818\n-0.1100975\n0.9123363\n\n\nROOMS\n0.0418089\n0.0036091\n11.5843972\n0.0000000\n\n\nNFAMS\n0.0328959\n0.0101097\n3.2538811\n0.0011458\n\n\nAGE\n-0.0035812\n0.0005551\n-6.4518343\n0.0000000\n\n\nMARSTMarried, spouse absent\n0.1202898\n0.0464015\n2.5923658\n0.0095588\n\n\nMARSTMarried, spouse present\n0.2037844\n0.0234430\n8.6927664\n0.0000000\n\n\nMARSTNever married/single\n0.1093652\n0.0241080\n4.5364680\n0.0000059\n\n\nMARSTSeparated\n0.0317790\n0.0447758\n0.7097359\n0.4779001\n\n\nMARSTWidowed\n0.1002446\n0.0360708\n2.7791094\n0.0054706\n\n\nRACEBlack/African American\n0.2424495\n0.0680585\n3.5623687\n0.0003709\n\n\nRACEChinese\n0.2866273\n0.0892431\n3.2117595\n0.0013274\n\n\nRACEJapanese\n0.3098268\n0.1428295\n2.1692071\n0.0301126\n\n\nRACEOther Asian or Pacific Islander\n0.3673041\n0.0716804\n5.1241908\n0.0000003\n\n\nRACEOther race, nec\n0.2807264\n0.0690309\n4.0666797\n0.0000484\n\n\nRACEThree or more major races\n0.3545589\n0.0965627\n3.6717982\n0.0002433\n\n\nRACETwo major races\n0.2827201\n0.0683850\n4.1342400\n0.0000362\n\n\nRACEWhite\n0.2663981\n0.0659347\n4.0403296\n0.0000542\n\n\nEMPSTATNot in labour force\n-0.0362414\n0.0222232\n-1.6307879\n0.1029963\n\n\nEMPSTATUnemployed\n0.0755285\n0.0431087\n1.7520454\n0.0798256\n\n\nREGION_CLASSIFIEDNORTHEAST\n0.2785538\n0.0244365\n11.3990853\n0.0000000\n\n\nREGION_CLASSIFIEDSOUTH\n0.1917026\n0.0213271\n8.9886669\n0.0000000\n\n\nREGION_CLASSIFIEDWEST\n0.4656973\n0.0227072\n20.5088390\n0.0000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coefficient (elasticity) of 0.1334 means that a 10% increase in total income (INCTOT) is associated with an average 1.334% increase in rent gross (RENTGRS), given that other variables in the model are held constant.\nThe idea in the above conclusion that higher income leads to increased rent payments is plausible. As people earn more, they may choose to live in better accommodations or neighborhoods, which could result in higher rent expenses.

This value looks modest. In practical terms, it suggests that the model doesn’t explain a large portion of the variance in the logarithm of rent. But in this social science and economic contexts, however, it is not uncommon to have lower R-squared values due to the complexity of human behavior and multiple unobserved factors. So we believe it is acceptable.\nThe p-value for the overall model is extremely low, which is good. It indicates that the model predictors, as a set, are statistically significantly associated with the response variable, the logarithm of rent.\nThe sigma value is the standard deviation of the error terms and is lower. This suggests that the residuals in this model are less spread out, indicating a tighter fit of the model to the data. However, since the scale is different from the previous model (which was on a log scale), this improvement is difficult to directly compare.\n\n\n\nResidual plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residuals appear to be centered around zero, which is good as it suggests no bias in the predictions.\nThere is some evidence of heteroscedasticity as the residuals seem to fan out as the fitted values increase, which is common in non-transformed data.\nThere are no clear patterns in the residuals, which suggests that the model catch the nonlinear relationships.\nThis log-transformed model seems to perform better in terms of having residuals more consistently distributed around zero. This suggests that the log transformation helped to stabilize the variance of the residuals and improve the model’s homoscedasticity."

It suggests that the mean is likely to be higher than the median, which corresponds to the stats in the above section. There are a few bars past the $6000 mark, which could be considered outliers. There’s a wide range of rents; however, the majority of the data points fall below $3000, suggesting that while there are rents across a wide range.\n2.INCTOT\n\nggplot(rent_data_clean, aes(x = INCTOT)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 100, fill = \"blue\", color = \"black\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Total Personal Income\",\n       x = \"Total Personal Income\",\n       y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram shows a very high peak at the lower end of the income range, suggest a right-skewed distribution.

The tail might include outliers, which are families with significantly higher incomes than the typical family and the variance and standard deviation are likely to be large.\n4.NFAMS\n\nnfams_counts &lt;- rent_data_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(NFAMS) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n())\n\nggplot(nfams_counts, aes(x = factor(NFAMS), y = Count, fill = factor(NFAMS))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Bar Chart of Number of Family Members\",\n       x = \"Number of Family Members\",\n       y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) \n\n\n\n\nThe bar representing one family member is significantly taller than the others, indicating that single-person families are most common in this dataset.

    "text": "Introduction\nThis dataset is derived from IPUMS Health Surveys. The sources are from the reputable institutions including The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Stat/Transfer, State Health Access Data Assistance Center, and the University of Minnesota, underscoring its credibility. The primary data are derived from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), which collectively offer a rich and comprehensive dataset representative of the U.S. population. This dataset includes a wide range of variables, both numerical and categorical. Numerical variables cover aspects such as the age of diabetes diagnosis, household weight, family income, educational attainment, poverty level, enrollment fees or premiums for Medicaid plans and etc. Categorical variables include race, insurance coverage, diabetic pill consumption, types of diabetes and etc. The dataset’s size is large, containing over 10,000,000 columns and 24 rows. The dataset’s compatibility can allow us to use dplyr, forcats, lubridate and other skills as we learnt in this class to manipulate and visualize, which makes it an excellent resource for applying and expanding upon the analytical skills developed in class. However, several challenges are anticipated in working with this dataset. One issue is the data was not from these two years. This could limit the accuracy of attributing findings to current conditions. Additionally, there are soma self-reported answers in this dataset, which introduces potential biases. But wee think the large sample size may mitigate the impact of individual errors or biases. Technical challenges may arise during the data analysis, particularly in categorizing and analyzing diverse groups within the dataset."
