## Our Topic
Our research aims to utilize 2022 U.S. data to determine whether income influences Americans' rental choices and to explore the impact of race, age, and other factors.

## Source
The data comes from [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml).

The original data of this website came from censuses as well as the American Community Surveys (ACS) that began in 2000 and are still going on today. We chose our dataset from this website because this site facilitates transformative research, education, and policy-making by aggregating data across times and places. It streamlines our analysis of changes,  data merging, and comparative research.

#### From [census.gov](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/03/low-income-renters-spent-larger-share-of-income-on-rent.html)
Research conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau from 2019 to 2021 indicates a widespread trend of increased rent burden among renter households across all income levels. Notably, the study shows that the lowest-income quantile experienced the most significant impact, with the number of cost-burdened renter-occupied households rising from 85.5% to 87.3%, equating to approximately 10.9 million households in 2021.

### A Harvard research: "More Renters Than Ever Before Are Burdened by the Rent They Pay" 
#### From [NEW YORK TIMES](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/realestate/rent-prices-housing.html#) 
The Harvard report also highlights this critical issue in the housing sector, revealing a substantial increase in rental burden across the United States using 2022 census data and draws similar concern as the study of U.S. Census Bureau. It found that an unprecedented 22.4 million households now allocate over 30% of their income to rent, with 12.1 million of U.S. households spending more than half of their income on this expense. This situation underscores the growing challenge of affordable housing, affecting renters' financial stability and quality of life.
