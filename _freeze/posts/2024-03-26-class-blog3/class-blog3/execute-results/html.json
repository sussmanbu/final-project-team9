The application of these principles ensures that our analysis is not only methodologically sound but also ethically conscious, especially in the context of housing affordability and equity.\n\nHow we present our data could influence: \nRacial equity (data involves race)\nPoverty equity (data involves poverty definition)\n\n\n#### Transparency \nOur research openly discusses the dataset's scope, including its geographic coverage and time period, provided by the IPUMS. We detail how the data were collected, acknowledging the reliance on census and ACS, which might include self-reported income or housing expenses. This acknowledgment is crucial as it allows us to identify potential biases or inaccuracies inherent in the data. For example, certain groups may be underrepresented due to the methodology of data collection, or there might be inaccuracies in self-reported income or expenses that could affect the analysis of income and rent relationships.Furthermore, by being transparent about the dataset's limitations, we aim to preemptively address any questions regarding the reliability and applicability of our findings. \n\n#### Beneficence and Addressing Disparities\nOur research utilizes the IPUMS data and aim to figure out disparities in housing affordability, particularly among marginalized communities. Through our analysis, we aim to identify areas, race groups where rent-to-income ratios are disproportionately different, where housing conditions may be inadequate, or where residents face significant utility burdens. Our intention is not merely to document disparities but to inform policy and intervention strategies that could alleviate such inequities. This means conducting our analysis with a clear purpose: to contribute to the discourse on housing equity and affordability in a way that is constructive and aimed at bringing about positive change. This approach aligns with the ethical obligation to use data in ways that can positively impact communities, especially those that are most vulnerable.\n\nWhat aspect our data and analysis could possibly influence: \nPossible social context for housing data\nPossible policy context for housing data\nPolicy decisions on the housing market\nFinancial decisions among different housing owner/buyers \nPublic perception of proverty\n\n## Problems and Challenges \n1. We ran into a problem that the data wasn't available for every year. So, we decided to focus on the data from 2022 since that was complete and the most up-to-date for our needs. For comparing how things have changed or stayed the same, we used data from the other years after we draw the conclusion based on 2022 dataset and do the comparsion based on it. This way, we could still make some good guesses about trends over time, using the best information we had.\n\n2. Code Conversion: Our dataset contains variables with specific codes that represent distinct groups or sets of individuals. For clarity in our analysis, it is essential to accurately interpret these codes. \n\nThe table below summarizes all variables that possess this characteristic:\n\n| Variable   | Description
