We chose our dataset from this website because this site facilitates transformative research, education, and policy-making by aggregating data across times and places. It streamlines our analysis of changes, data merging, and comparative research.\n\n## Other Research on Similar Topics\n### A U.S. Census Bureau reasearch: \"Share of Income Needed to Pay Rent Increased the Most for Low-Income Households From 2019 to 2021\"\n\n#### From [Census.Gov](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/03/low-income-renters-spent-larger-share-of-income-on-rent.html)\n\nResearch conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau from 2019 to 2021 indicates a widespread trend of increased rent burden among renter households across all income levels. Notably, the study shows that the lowest-income quantile experienced the most significant impact, with the number of cost-burdened renter-occupied households rising from 85.5% to 87.3%, equating to approximately 10.9 million households in 2021.\n\n### A Harvard research: \"More Renters Than Ever Before Are Burdened by the Rent They Pay\"\n\n#### From [NEW YORK TIMES](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/realestate/rent-prices-housing.html#)\n\nThe Harvard report also highlights this critical issue in the housing sector, revealing a substantial increase in rental burden across the United States using 2022 census data and draws similar concern as the study of U.S. Census Bureau. It found that an unprecedented 22.4 million households now allocate over 30% of their income to rent, with 12.1 million of U.S. households spending more than half of their income on this expense. This situation underscores the growing challenge of affordable housing, affecting renters' financial stability and quality of life.\n\n## Reference:\nKaysen, R. (2024, January 25).

characterized by specific codes indicative of missing or unknown values, as well as those representing values deemed inappropriate for analytical purposes.  Furthermore, for our dependent variable—rent—we exclude records indicating a rent of 0. This exclusion is based on the understanding that a 0 rent suggests the individual owns their home or lives in a situation not pertinent to our target research population, which is individuals who rent their housing. Given the original dataset comprises millions of samples, the exclusion of these data points still leaves us with this sufficiently large dataset for robust analysis.\n\n\n",
