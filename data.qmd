## Describe where/how to find data.
Our dataset comes from [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml). 

Reference:
Steven Ruggles, Sarah Flood, Matthew Sobek, Daniel Backman, Annie Chen, Grace Cooper, Stephanie Richards, Renae Rodgers, and Megan Schouweiler. IPUMS USA: Version 15.0 [dataset]. Minneapolis, MN: IPUMS, 2024.

The original data of this website came from censuses as well as the American Community Surveys (ACS) that began in 2000 and are still going on today. We chose our dataset from this website IPUMS because this website contains datasets that are large, valid and complex, containing detailed microdata, which aims to facilitate transformative research, education, and policy-making by aggregating data across times and places. It makes the datasets on this website very appropriate for our research to streamline our analysis of changes, data merging, and comparative research.
  
  
## Describe the different data files used and what each variable means.

### Table contains all the variables we have
We have highlighted all key dependent variables (RENTGRS) and independent variables (INCTOT) in bold.
| Variable | Description                           |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| **RENTGRS**  | Monthly gross rent                    |
| KITCHEN  | Kitchen or cooking facilities         |
| ROOMS    | Number of rooms                       |

| AGE      | Age                                   |

## Describe any cleaning you had to do for your data.
- Here is the link to our cleaned dataset [cleaned dataset.](./dataset//rent_income.rds)

- The code for cleaning and recoding the datasets, please see class blog 2 and 3. 

- For our dependent variable—rent—we exclude records indicating a rent of 0. This exclusion is based on the understanding that a 0 rent suggests the individual owns their home or lives in a situation not pertinent to our target research population, which is individuals who rent their housing.

- Exclude data entries characterized by specific codes indicative of missing or unknown values, as well as those representing values deemed inappropriate for analytical purposes. The following table shows the variables we processed:
* Given the vast size of the original dataset, which includes millions of records, we opted to remove these entries directly. This decision does not compromise our ability to conduct a thorough analysis, as the remaining dataset is still large and clean enough for reliable and robust research conclusions.

- Recode certain variables. We modified certain variables in the dataset that are encoded with specific numerical codes, which reflect categories or qualitative information rather than quantitative values.
The following table:

- The original data source provided datasets for specific years, not in a continuous sequence. Our primary focus was on the latest data from 2022 for initial research. However, we plan to expand our analysis by incorporating data from 2019 and other years, allowing for comparative studies across different years.
