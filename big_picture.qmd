# Introduction
Imagine every year, as the calendar turns, you write a bigger check for your rent. You're not alone. Across the country, millions are penning this annual escalation into their ledgers. But there's another figure that's climbing too—your income. Let's explore this curious dance of numbers and what it means for the roof over your head.

## The Dance Begins: Rising Rent
As the years roll by, the cost of renting a home has steadily increased. We've tracked this change using data from the IPUMS ACS, and the patterns are clear. The graph below is not just a line climbing a chart; it's a reflection of changing lives, of budgets adjusted, and of the increasing value we place on our homes.


#### Trend of Median Rent Over the Years
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
annual_median_rent <- data_twenty %>%
  group_by(YEAR) %>%
  summarize(MedianRent = median(RENTGRS, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(annual_median_rent, aes(x = YEAR, y = MedianRent)) +
  geom_line(size=1.2, color="#95A5A6") + 
  geom_point(size=1.5, color="#3498DB", shape=21, fill="#3498DB") +  
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +  
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=15, face="bold", color="#34495E"), 
    axis.title = element_text(size=10, face="bold", color="#34495E"),  
    axis.text = element_text(color="#34495E"), 
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color="#ECF0F1", size=0.2),  
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
    legend.position = "none",
    plot.margin = margin(5.5, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5, "mm")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Trend of Median Rent Over the Years",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Median Gross Rent",
    caption = "Data Source: IPUMS"  
  )
```

## A Sigh of Relief: Rising Income

But as rent demands more from our wallets, something else is happening. Our incomes are also on an upward trajectory. This next graph isn't just about higher wages; it’s about the resilience and growth that have characterized our economy and personal financial stories.

#### Trend of Median Personal Income Over the Years
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
annual_median_income <- data_twenty %>%
  group_by(YEAR) %>%
  summarize(MedianIncome = median(INCTOT, na.rm = TRUE))
ggplot(annual_median_income, aes(x = YEAR, y = MedianIncome)) +
  geom_line(size=1.2, color="#95A5A6") + 
  geom_point(size=1.5, color="#3498DB", shape=21, fill="#3498DB") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=15, face="bold", color="#34495E"),
    axis.title = element_text(size=10, face="bold", color="#34495E"),
    axis.text = element_text(color="#34495E"),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color="#ECF0F1", size=0.2),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "none",
    plot.margin = margin(5.5, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5, "mm")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Trend of Median Personal Income Over the Years",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Median Gross Personal Income",

## Bridging the Graphs: Analysis and Insights

While we've seen the upward trends in both rent and income through our graphs, let's take a closer look at what these changes really mean. Our analysis goes beyond simple observation and digs into how these financial changes affect each other and what this might mean for you.

### Understanding the Model's Message

Our analysis used a special kind of mathematical model to predict how changes in income affect rent. Here’s what we found: if incomes go up by 10%, rent could increase by about 13.34% on average. This isn't just a random guess; it's a prediction backed by strong data, showing us how closely linked our earnings are to what we pay for housing.

### Explaining the Findings in Everyday Terms

- **How Rent Reacts to Income**: The number 0.1334 from our model tells us that rent doesn’t just increase slightly when incomes go up; it jumps by a noticeable amount. Imagine getting a 100 dollar increase in your monthly pay; this model predicts that your rent could go up by about 13.34 dollar. So, as we earn more, we also tend to spend more on rent.
  
- **Confidence in Our Model**: The details behind these numbers are very reliable. The data tells us this isn’t just happening by chance—it’s a real pattern that we see repeatedly in the numbers.

### Wrapping Up: What This Means for Us

This deep dive into the numbers helps us understand the tricky balance between earning more and the rising cost of living, especially when it comes to housing. It’s clear that as our incomes grow, so does the amount we have to pay in rent, often faster than we might hope. This can help everyone, from policymakers to renters, understand and plan better for the future.

## Rubric: On this page

You will

* Title
  * Your big picture page should have a creative/click-bait-y title/headline that provides a hint about your thesis.
* Clarity of Explanation
  * You should have a clear thesis/goal for this page. What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don't go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.
  * Each figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.
* Creativity
  * Do your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.
* This page should be self-contained.
  
**Note**: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use `#| echo: FALSE`.

## Rubric: Other components

### Interactive

You will also be required to make an interactive dashboard like [this one](/flex/flex.html).

Your Big Data page should include a link to an interactive dashboard. The dashboard should be created either using Shiny or FlexDashboard (or another tool with professor's approval). This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.

* Quality and ease of use of the interactive components.
Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components?
Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions from the Big Picture?
Plotly with default hover text will get no credit. Be creative!


### Video Recording

Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components.
You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA.
This video should be no longer than 4 minutes.
Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website.
This can be presented by any subset of the team members.


### Rest of the Site

Finally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site. 

The main title of your page is informative.
Each post has an author/description/informative title.
All lab required posts are present.
Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it.
Your about page is up to date and clean.
You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template.
